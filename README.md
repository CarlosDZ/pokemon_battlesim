## Pokemon Battle Simulator By CarlosDZ
# V 1.0

Short Description:
In this program, two players can create a pokemon team for each one, and play a battle against each other with those teams.
This program is made in Spanish, tough im writing the README in english, wich proves im kind of dumb.

Pokemon related Info:
This program's movepool, itempool, abilitypool and pokemonpool is based on the OU format on february 2025. This doesnt include complex mechanics like terastalization, mega evolutions, z movements, etc...
There may be things that are a bit different from normal pokemon battles, they might be implemented later or purposely choosen to not be included. If you want more information, there is a list of things that dont work and i want to include in later versions below.

Java Warnings:
I had no time to add error handling to this project so, i highly recomend not to write things that are not numbers when it says to choose a number. Thanks :D
Also, this code is probably not so optimized, anyways it shouldnt be a problem as it is very light.

Things that "are" in the game but doesnt work:
- Abilities: They do nothing at this moment
- Items: They also do nothing at this moment
- Effects of movements: If a movement doesnt have a descryption in game, his secundary effect is not programed yet.
- Altered States: They are there only to make it easier to implement them on the future.
- Confusion, Sleep, Etc: Same as altered States
- The "Struggle" mechanic: If a pokemon doesnt have any PP left, is a rock. It just cant struggle, so if you have 6 pokemons with 0 PP, you have to forfeit.

Things that i want to implement:
- Everything on the previous list
- Way more pokemons (and their abilities)
- Way more movements
- More items
- The option to save and load teams.
